# burritomansshittyprojects
Here I post multitude of dumb things I end up programming, they probably ain't the fastest, the smallest or most efficient but I really don't care

This project is mainly as way to challenge myself and to improve and develop my skills, I'll try to add explanation of the code and make it as concise as possible
*DO NOT* take any of the multiple programs in here as serious.

***All the code here is free to take (At your own risk), I just want the comment mentioning me as the developer and the link to this repository***
